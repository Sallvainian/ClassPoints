# Document Summary

This UX Design Specification provides a comprehensive guide for implementing ClassPoints as a ClassDojo-inspired classroom behavior management application optimized for Smart Boards.

**Key Design Decisions:**

1. **ClassDojo clone approach** - Leverage proven patterns, differentiate on speed/simplicity
2. **Smart Board optimization** - Large touch targets, classroom-visible feedback
3. **Calibrated celebrations** - Noticeable but not disruptive (0.5-1s animations)
4. **Tailwind CSS v4** - Utility-first styling with design tokens
5. **Teacher in control, students engaged** - Dual-audience emotional design

**Implementation Priorities:**

1. Core loop (tap → select → award)
2. Student grid with proper sizing
3. Behavior modal with instant response
4. Point animations and feedback
5. Sound effects and celebrations

**Next Steps:**

- Architecture design (if not already complete)
- Epic and story generation for implementation
- Component development following this specification
- User testing with teachers on actual Smart Boards
